# Introduction

Wecome to *Building a Book with {{site.data.macros.latex}}!* This project is set up to help explore what goes into typesetting a book in {{site.data.macros.latex}} and what one can get out of it.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

## What are the tools we need?

You will need the following tools:

* Git
* A GitHub account
* A copy of {{site.data.macros.latex}} as well as {{site.data.macros.xelatex}}
* The [Gentium Book Basic](http://software.sil.org/gentium/) font

## What prerequisites should I have?

You will need the following things under your belt:

* A basic knowledge of Git
* An understanding of the basics of copyediting
* Knowledge of editing plain-text source files (I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io) with the `language-latex` package installed for working with {{site.data.macros.latex}})
