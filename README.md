# Welcome to the {{site.data.macros.latex}} Book Tutorial!

In this tutorial, we’ll be creating a book in {{site.data.macros.latex}} from scratch. We’ll go through the process of setting up the content, the display, custom design, copyediting and proofing, preparing for printing, and conversions. The tutorial will be broken into lessons

## Lessons

### [Introduction](intro)

Before we get started, lets look at some goals and prerequisites.

### [Lesson 1](lesson-1)

In this lesson, you will be introduced to {{site.data.macros.latex}} and its basic structure. We'll be starting our publication project: a new print copy of Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventues in Wonderland*, which is in the public domain.

### [Lesson 2](lesson-2)

In this lesson, we'll add the content of the book *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* to our {{site.data.macros.latex}} file.
